## What is Gravity Compensation?

Gravity compensation is a fundamental concept in robotic control that helps counteract the effects of gravity on a robot's joints and links. By applying the necessary motor current to balance this torque, the robotic joint can remain stationary at any position without additional external forces.

## Why is it so important?

In robotics, a significant portion of motor power is consumed just fighting against gravity. Gravity compensation algorithms are standard in all industrial robots and collaborative robot arms because they provide: improved position accuracy and control, smoother motion planning, and more precise force control applications. The gravity compensation algorithm works as a feedforward component to the motor PID control loops, reducing their computational load and improving overall performance.

## The Approach

In this example, we use the Robotics Toolbox for Python to model a "robotic arm" with a single revolute joint. We compute the required torque using the Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA) and convert this torque into a motor current/torque that the motor controller will command the motor. In this blog post we will explain in short pseudo code snippets how the algorithm works on a single DOF arm.
